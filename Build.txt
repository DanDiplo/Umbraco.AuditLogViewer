To Build:

Run build.bat in /BuildPackage from command line.

If all works the NuGet and Umbraco packages will be created in the /BuildPackage/Package folder

Consult the readme.txt in /BuildPackage/ for more details.

You can install a NuGet package locally from the VS NuGet package manager console:

Install-Package C:\Path\To\Some\MyPackage.nupkg
