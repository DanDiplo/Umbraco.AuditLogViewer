      <![CDATA[Diplo Audit Log Viewer for Umbraco CMS (8 and above) allows you to easily view and search the content and audit data that is stored in your Umbraco 8 site's umbracoLog and umbracoAudit tables.

It creates a custom tree within the Settings that lets you view the contents of both those tables and presents the results in a filterbale, sortable and searchable paginated list.

      You can:

      * Filter log data by log type (Save, Publish, Delete etc)
      * Filter by user (ie. person responsible)
      * Filter by date or date range (ie. all audit events that occurred within a given period)
      * Filter by node (with easy to use content-picker)
      * Search the log data comments by keyword
      * Handy quick filters for the more common audit tasks
      * Uses fast, server side pagination of data so it should be quick no matter how large your table has become
      * Quick "edit" links to affected content

Note: Please use the 1.x version for Umbraco 7 sites.]]>
